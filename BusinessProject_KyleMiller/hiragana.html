    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
            <p>Hiragana is the first writing system you'll learn when studying Japanese. It consists of 46 characters, and each one represents a distinct syllable, like "か" (ka) or "た" (ta). Unlike the English alphabet, where letters are combined to make sounds, each hiragana character already represents a full sound.<br></p>

            <p>You'll use hiragana for many things in Japanese. It's used for native Japanese words that don't have a kanji form, as well as for grammatical elements like particles and verb endings. It's also used to write furigana, which are smaller hiragana characters next to kanji to show how the kanji should be read.<br></p>
            
            <p>Learning hiragana is the first step to reading and writing Japanese. It helps you understand sentence structure, grammar, and basic vocabulary. Once you master it, you'll be able to start reading simple texts, writing basic sentences, and using correct grammar. Even as you learn more advanced Japanese, hiragana will always be essential. It's used in almost everything, from daily communication to more formal writing.<br></p>
