    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        
            <p>Kanji is the third writing system you'll learn in Japanese. Unlike hiragana and katakana, which each represent a single syllable, each kanji character represents a concept or whole word—like "山" (yama, "mountain") or "水" (mizu, "water"). There are thousands of kanji in use, and many characters have more than one pronunciation depending on context.<br></p>
    
            <p>You'll use kanji for most nouns, the stems of verbs and adjectives, and in compound words. It appears everywhere—from street signs and menus to books and newspapers—and knowing it lets you grasp meaning at a glance. For example, 大学 (daigaku, "university") combines 大 ("big") and 学 ("study"), while 自転車 (jitensha, "bicycle") pairs 自 ("self"), 転 ("turn"), and 車 ("vehicle").<br></p>
            
            <p>Learning kanji unlocks the ability to read authentic Japanese text. Start with the most common characters, and you'll soon recognize basic words and phrases. As you progress, your kanji knowledge will grow alongside your vocabulary, empowering you to tackle ever more complex reading—and to express nuanced ideas in writing. Kanji study is a lifelong journey, but mastering even the core set opens up a world of Japanese language and culture.<br></p>
            
            <p>You don't need to memorize every kanji before you start reading and writing. In Japanese schools— and in most self-study approaches— characters are introduced gradually, often grouped by frequency or by the grade level at which Japanese children encounter them. However you choose to study, your course or guide will likely introduce Kanji in the context of real words and sentences. This means you can pick them up as you go, often alongside new vocabulary.</p>
