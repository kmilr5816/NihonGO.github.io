    <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>Pitch accent is an important part of Japanese pronunciation. It refers to the way the pitch of your voice rises or falls within a word—like how in English, record (noun) and record (verb) have different stresses. In Japanese, where you place the pitch drop can completely change the meaning, even if the word sounds otherwise the same.<br></p>

            <p>You'll encounter pitch accent everywhere, from casual conversations to formal speeches. Native speakers use it naturally, and it plays a key role in making your Japanese sound clear and natural. Words like はし can mean "bridge" or "chopsticks" depending on the pitch, so getting it right can help you avoid confusion.<br></p>
            
            <p>Learning pitch accent is a step toward more natural-sounding Japanese. While it's not something you have to master perfectly right away, becoming aware of it early will make it easier to develop a good ear for the language. As you hear more Japanese—through conversation, TV shows, songs, or podcasts—you'll start picking up patterns naturally. Over time, correct pitch accent will feel more intuitive, helping you sound more fluent and polished.<br></p>

        Pitch accent is something to be aware of but isn't necessary for your learning comprehension. However, if you want to sound natural, it's still a good idea to study it.
